=== The No Free Lunch Theorem

[NOTE] 
.By http://www.no-free-lunch.org/[David Wolpert]
==== 
Averaged over all possible data generating distributions, every classification algorithm has the same error
rate when classifying previously unobserved points.
====

[NOTE.speaker]
--
- Ian Goodfellow: No machine learning algorithm is universally any better than any other.
- Extra: The most sophisticated algorithm we can conceive of has the same average performance (over
all possible tasks) as merely predicting that every point belongs to the same class.

=== Machine Learning means

[NOTE] 
.By https://www.deeplearningbook.org/[Ian Goodfellow]
==== 
This means that the goal of machine learning research is not to seek a universal learning algorithm or the absolute best learning algorithm. Instead, **our goal is to understand what kinds of distributions are relevant to the “real world”** that an AI agent experiences, and what kinds of machine learning algorithms perform well on data drawn from the kinds of data generating distributions we care about.

[NOTE.speaker]

- Show you yet another technique: Deep Learning!
